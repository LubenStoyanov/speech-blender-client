# Speech Blender
Speech Blender is a web application that allows users to blend multiple audio recordings or spoken language segments into a single cohesive audio file. Users can upload their own recordings or use their computer's microphone to record new segments, and then adjust the timing, volume, and other aspects of each segment before blending them together.

## Features
